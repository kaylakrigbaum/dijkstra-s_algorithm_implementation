# Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation

Create a graph of 7 cities of your choice and set the weight of the edges to  be the distance between the chosen cities, every city must be connected to 3 cities. 

- Use an array of of lists type of pairs to store the graph. use a parallel array to store the name of the cities. create a function to find the shortest path between 2 cities chosen by the user. 
- Use Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph.
- Provide a graphical presentation for the graph.
